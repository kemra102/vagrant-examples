# vagrant-examples

Some example Vagrant congfigs. Not always as simple as some comparative examples, but they aim to teach some Chef as well as they go as well as some more advanced aspects of Vagrant.

Each example has it's own README you should review if you are following this as a learning guide. Each example builds on the previous one so won't necessarily re-iterate commands given previously, you're expected to remember them or review the previous examples as required.

## Requirements

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) (This author recommends your OS's package manager if it's available there.)
* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (This author recommends the provided Linux repos if you're on Linux, or `brew` if you're on Mac OSX.)
